# Fizz Buzz Tree
 Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value. There is one return from this function, the mutated tree.

## Challenge

    Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
    Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with it’s news values.
Assuming access to both the node class and the binaryTree class (no changes were made at the class level).
